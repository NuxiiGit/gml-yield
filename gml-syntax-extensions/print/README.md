# Print

This short macro enables the use of `PRINT` to display messages in [GameMaker Studio 2](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker).

## Usage example

This extension is very simple, requiring the keyword `PRINT` followed by a value to display in the console:

```js
PRINT 1 + 2;
PRINT "hello world";
```
